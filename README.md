Description of the project:

Code for folding the events recorded by the CZTI and the LAXPC backend of AstroSAT (India's first space based observatory). The figure above shows the pulse profile of the Crab pulsar (PSR J0534+2200) obatined by using the code on the CZTI data of AstroSAT.
It requires the barycentric corrected eventfiles for folding the data and the parameter file used by the pulsar timing package TEMPO2.
In future, this code will come with support for folding the data from Fermi-LAT observatory, which will be useful for folding the gamma-ray photons from the pulsars.
